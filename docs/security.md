# Security & Approval Model

Bud operates under a strict principle of least surprise: **Read is automatic; Write requires explicit user consent.**

## The Approval Flow
1. When Bud plans a side-effect (e.g. creating a workspace file, modifying a calendar event, or sending a draft), it registers an exact `approval_id`.
2. The execution pauses, surfacing the proposal to the user (in terminal, web, or iMessage).
3. The user grants approval via exact reference (`/approve <id>`) or denies it (`/deny <id>`).
4. Replayed or duplicated dispatches verify pre-conditions against SQLite claim records to prevent double-execution.
